# React - Personal Projects

In this folder, you will find all my work inspired by various interesting concepts I discovered on the web.

## Folder Content

1. [Weather App](/REACT/React%20-%20Personal%20Project/01%20-%20Weather%20App/weather-app)<br>
   This application allows users to check the weather forecast for their location and any other location around the world. It utilizes a weather API to fetch real-time weather data and provides users with a clean interface to view the weather forecast.

2. [Sudoku](/REACT/React%20-%20Personal%20Project/02%20-%20Sudoku/sudoku)<br>
   This application allows you to play Sudoku puzzles with three levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

## How To Use Code Snapshots

Of course, you can also try running those code snapshots on your machine. You'll need to run `npm install` in the individual snapshot folders, followed by `npm start` to start the development server.
